# Installation

AVEVA Adapters are installed on local machines and can be deployed in three different ways:

- You can install them using an install kit downloaded from the OSIsoft Customer Portal. For instructions on downloading and installing adapters, see  [Install the adapter](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/aveva-adapter-opc-ua/page/main/shared-content/installation/install-the-adapter.html).
- You can build custom installers or containers for Linux. For more information, see the Docker instructions in the documentation of the respective adapter.
- If you have many devices to manage and are looking for a central location to do bulk adapter rollouts, you can remotely deploy adapters via edge modules using Edge Management in AVEVA Data Hub.
